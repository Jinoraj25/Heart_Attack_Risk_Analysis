## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of health dataset  
- Visualization of important factors such as:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Smoking
  - Hypertension
  - Glucose Level
  - Population statistics  
- Heart attack risk prediction insights

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jinoraj25/Heart_Attack_Risk_Analysis.git
```

2. Open the notebook:

```bash
Heart Disease Risk Prediction Using Real-World Health Data (Framingham Study) (1).ipynb
```

3. Run the cells sequentially to see analysis and plots.  
4. All generated plots are saved in the `images/` folder.
